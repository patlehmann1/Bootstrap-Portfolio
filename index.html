                    New York transplant and skilled trades/retail worker with over 15 years of customer service experience. Strong communication skills, attention to details and a desire to learn are what drives me to excel in web development. I am dedicated to learning the craft and perfecting my skills daily. Growing up, I was always drawn to my home computer and the internet. I saw web development and coding as too hard for me though and I didn't think I would be able to compete. A couple years ago, a few friends of mine went to a coding bootcamp and they were successful. They enjoy their jobs and do well for themselves. I decided I would start to learn some on my own to see if it is for me. I enjoyed it so much, I decided to sign up for myself! Definitely a decision I don't regret and I'm happy to be here!
